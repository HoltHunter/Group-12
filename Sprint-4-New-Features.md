# Sprint 4 New Features
## Group 12


## Feature 1: Themes

Users will be able to select a theme to view the app, e.g., Dark Theme. We will also have options Classic, Monochrome, and Bright.

## Feature 2: Profile Icons

Users can select an Icon for their profile. This is similar to profile pictures, but will be from a predrawn set of icons. This removes the need to moderate illegal pictures that could be uploaded.
