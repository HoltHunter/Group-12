// Can model this component on UserCard, to start.

// Need to render the following:
// 1. User First & Last Names
// 2. Post create timestamp
// 3. Post content
// 4. Like button -> This could be its own component, LikeButton.js, as a specific implementation of IconButton?
// 5. Comment button -> This could be its own component, CommentField.js
// 6. Share button 
// 7. User icon / profile pic. Can use a placeholder for now, like UserCard does.
// 8. User name is a link to user Profile.
